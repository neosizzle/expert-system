A + B => C + D
=A
?C


# What is C? Need to find what is A + B
# 	Need to solve rule A + B
# 		What is A?
# 			false by fact
# 		What is B?
# 			true by fact
# 	Rule A + B is true
# LHS is false, implies rule C + D can be false or true
# What is D?
#	false by fact
# Possible values of C = [false]
# [false] by deduction
