# What is D? Need to find out what is rule B + C
# 	Need to solve rule B + C
#		What is B? Need to find out what is rule A
#			What is A?
#				false by fact
#			Rule A is false
#		LHS is false, implies that rule B is [true, false]
#		Possible values of B = [true, false]
#		What is C?
#			true by fact
#		Possible values of C = [true]
# LHS is both true or false
# LHS is true, implies rule D is true
# LHS is false, implies rule D is false, or true
# Possible values of D = [true, false]
# [true, false] by deduction
