A + B => C + D
=AB
?C


# What is C? Need to find what is A + B
#	Need to solve rule A + B
# 		What is A?
# 			true by fact
# 		What is B?
# 			true by fact
#	Rule A + B is true
# LHS is true, implies rule C + D is true
# Possible values of C = [true]
# Possible values of D = [true]
# [true] by deduction
