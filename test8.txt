# What is D? Need to find out what is rule B | C
# 	Need to solve rule B | C
#		What is B? Need to find out what is rule A
#			What is A?
#				true by fact
#			Rule A is true
#		LHS is true, implies that rule B | C is true
#		Possible values of B = [true, false, true]
#		Possible values of C = [true, true, false] -> cached
#		What is C?
#		Possible values of C = [true, true, false] -> cached
# LHS is true due to mapping of all symbols's possible values are true
# LHS is true, implies rule D is true
# Possible values of D = [true]
# [true] by deduction
