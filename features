Parenthesis handling
Multi operator rules
Priority resolution of RHS symbols (Other rules -> hard RHS result constraints -> false fact)

TODO
rule search by single symbol on rhs OK
implication switch
Binary gate solvers OK

generate possible valeus for all symbols in symbollist when rule is true  / false
- should be built in truth table generator
- should be exaustive on both side, allow duplicates if needed
- for the mapping and counting using the reuslt when resolving, use the number of maps of the smallest mapping if that number is in the same rule

logic to traverse symbol list as binary (1 symbol, 1 operator, 1 symbol for binary gate solver)
Cache to store symbols to results which maps both negated and non negated symbols
